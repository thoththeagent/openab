# Scheduled Messages (Config-Driven Cron)

Send recurring prompts to your agent on a schedule — daily summaries, weekly reports, periodic scans — without external infrastructure.

## How It Works

1. Define `[[cron.jobs]]` entries in `config.toml`
2. OpenAB's internal scheduler evaluates cron expressions once per minute
3. When a schedule matches, the message is sent to the agent as if a user typed it
4. The agent processes the message and replies to the target channel

No external scheduler (K8s CronJob, GitHub Actions) is needed for simple use cases.

## Quick Start

Add to your `config.toml`:

```toml
[[cron.jobs]]
schedule = "0 9 * * 1-5"
channel = "123456789012345678"
message = "summarize yesterday's merged PRs"
```

This sends `summarize yesterday's merged PRs` to the agent every weekday at 09:00 UTC in the specified Discord channel.

## Configuration

Each `[[cron.jobs]]` entry supports these fields:

```toml
[[cron.jobs]]
enabled = true                               # optional, default: true
schedule = "0 9 * * 1-5"                    # required: cron expression
channel = "123456789012345678"               # required: target channel ID
message = "summarize yesterday's merged PRs" # required: prompt for the agent
platform = "discord"                         # optional, default: "discord"
sender_name = "DailyOps"                     # optional, default: "openab-cron"
timezone = "America/New_York"                     # optional, default: "UTC"
thread_id = ""                               # optional: post to existing thread
```

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | | `true` | Set `false` to disable without removing the entry |
| `schedule` | ✅ | — | 5-field POSIX cron expression |
| `channel` | ✅ | — | Discord channel/thread ID, Slack channel ID, Telegram chat ID, Google Chat space name, or LINE WORKS channel ID / `user:<userId>` |
| `message` | ✅ | — | Message sent to the agent as a prompt |
| `platform` | | `"discord"` | `"discord"`, `"slack"`, `"telegram"`, `"googlechat"`, or `"lineworks"` (non-default platforms require their feature) |
| `sender_name` | | `"openab-cron"` | Attribution shown in prompt context |
| `timezone` | | `"UTC"` | IANA timezone (e.g. `"America/New_York"`, `"Europe/Berlin"`) |
| `thread_id` | | — | Post into an existing thread instead of the channel |

## Cron Expression Format

Standard 5-field POSIX cron, same as Linux crontab, K8s CronJob, and GitHub Actions:

```
┌───────────── minute (0-59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0-23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1-31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1-12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0-7, 0 and 7 = Sunday)
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

### Examples

| Expression | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0 9 * * 1-5` | Weekdays at 09:00 |
| `0 0 * * 0` | Sundays at midnight |
| `*/30 * * * *` | Every 30 minutes |
| `0 18 * * 1-5` | Weekdays at 18:00 |
| `0 9 1 * *` | First day of every month at 09:00 |

## Timezone Support

By default, schedules are evaluated in UTC. Set `timezone` to any IANA timezone:

```toml
[[cron.jobs]]
schedule = "0 9 * * 1-5"
channel = "123456789012345678"
message = "good morning team, here's today's agenda"
timezone = "America/New_York"
```

This fires at 09:00 New York time (13:00 or 14:00 UTC depending on DST).

## Multiple Jobs

Define as many `[[cron.jobs]]` entries as you need:

```toml
[[cron.jobs]]
schedule = "0 9 * * 1-5"
channel = "123456789012345678"
message = "summarize yesterday's merged PRs"
sender_name = "DailyOps"
timezone = "America/New_York"

[[cron.jobs]]
schedule = "0 0 * * 0"
channel = "123456789012345678"
message = "generate weekly status report"
sender_name = "WeeklyReport"

[[cron.jobs]]
schedule = "0 18 * * 1-5"
channel = "C0123456789"
message = "check for any critical alerts in the last 8 hours"
platform = "slack"
sender_name = "OpsBot"

[[cron.jobs]]
schedule = "* * * * *"
channel = "176096071"
message = "講一個冷笑話"
platform = "telegram"
sender_name = "JokeBot"

[[cron.jobs]]
schedule = "0 9 * * 1-5"
channel = "spaces/AAAA1234567"
message = "summarize the new support escalations"
platform = "googlechat"
sender_name = "SupportDigest"
timezone = "Asia/Taipei"
```

## Helm Deployment

When using the Helm chart, define cronjobs under each agent in `values.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  kiro:
    cronjobs:
      - schedule: "0 9 * * 1-5"
        channel: "123456789012345678"
        message: "summarize yesterday's merged PRs"
        platform: "discord"
        senderName: "DailyOps"
        timezone: "America/New_York"
      - schedule: "0 0 * * 0"
        channel: "123456789012345678"
        message: "generate weekly status report"
```

> ⚠️ Use `--set-string` for channel IDs to avoid float64 precision loss:
> ```bash
> helm upgrade mybot charts/openab \
>   --set-string agents.kiro.cronjobs[0].channel="123456789012345678"
> ```

## Usercron — Hot-Reload with `cronjob.toml`

Cronjobs defined in `config.toml` require a redeploy to change. **Usercron** lets you manage schedules in a separate `cronjob.toml` file that the scheduler hot-reloads automatically — no restart needed.

### Enable Usercron

Add to your `config.toml`:

```toml
[cron]
usercron_enabled = true
usercron_path = "cronjob.toml"
```

Usercron is **disabled by default**. Both fields are required to activate it.

#### Minimal config.toml example

```toml
[discord]
bot_token = "${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}"

[agent]
command = "kiro-cli"
args = ["acp", "--trust-all-tools"]
working_dir = "/home/agent"

[cron]
usercron_enabled = true
usercron_path = "cronjob.toml"    # → $HOME/.openab/cronjob.toml
```

> Note: Everything cron-related lives under `[cron]` — both usercron settings and baseline `[[cron.jobs]]`.

The path is relative to `$HOME/.openab/` (e.g. `"cronjob.toml"` resolves to `$HOME/.openab/cronjob.toml`). Absolute paths are used as-is. The scheduler starts watching immediately, even if the file doesn't exist yet.

> **New installations**: If `~/.openab/` does not exist yet, the scheduler silently skips the file and continues running. Once you create the directory and place `cronjob.toml` inside, it will be picked up automatically on the next tick — no restart required.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Breaking Change (v0.8.2)** — `usercron_path` relative path base changed from `$HOME` to `$HOME/.openab/`.
> If you are upgrading from a previous version, move your existing file:
> ```bash
> mkdir -p ~/.openab
> mv ~/cronjob.toml ~/.openab/cronjob.toml
> ```

### Create `cronjob.toml`

Same format as `[[cron.jobs]]` in config.toml, but uses `[[jobs]]`:

```toml
[[jobs]]
schedule = "* * * * *"
channel = "1490282656913559673"
message = "ping"
platform = "discord"
sender_name = "usercron"
timezone = "Asia/Taipei"

[[jobs]]
schedule = "0 9 * * 1-5"
channel = "1490282656913559673"
message = "summarize yesterday's merged PRs"
sender_name = "DailyOps"
timezone = "Asia/Taipei"
```

### How It Works

                         config.toml                   $HOME/.openab/cronjob.toml

                                                            → agent processes
```

1. Every scheduler tick (~1 minute), the file's modification time is checked
2. If the file changed → re-parse and replace the dynamic job list
3. `config.toml` `[[cron.jobs]]` are the **immutable baseline**; `cronjob.toml` jobs are the **dynamic overlay**
4. Invalid TOML or bad entries are logged and skipped — baseline jobs are never affected
5. Deleting the file removes all dynamic jobs (baseline jobs continue)

### Agent-Managed Schedules

Because `cronjob.toml` is a plain file, your agent can write to it directly:

```
User: set up a cronjob that pings me every minute
Agent: ✅ Written to cronjob.toml, takes effect within 1 minute
```

This enables mobile-friendly schedule management — talk to your agent from your phone, and it updates the cron file for you.

### Goal-Driven Auto-Disable

Usercron jobs can stop themselves once a goal is complete. Add `disable_on_success` to run a command before the scheduled prompt is sent. The job is considered complete only when the command exits `0` **and** stdout or stderr contains `disable_on_success_match`.

```toml
[[jobs]]
id = "fix-unit-tests"                       # required for scheduler writeback
enabled = true
schedule = "*/10 * * * *"
channel = "1490282656913559673"
message = "Unit tests are still failing. Continue fixing them and report progress."

disable_on_success = "npm test && echo OPENAB_GOAL_SUCCESS"
disable_on_success_match = "OPENAB_GOAL_SUCCESS"
disable_on_success_timeout_secs = 120
disable_on_success_working_dir = "/workspace/my-project"
```

Execution flow:

1. The schedule matches.
2. The scheduler runs `disable_on_success`.
3. If the command exits `0` and output contains `disable_on_success_match`, OpenAB posts `✅ Goal achieved`, writes `enabled = false` back to `$HOME/.openab/cronjob.toml`, and skips the regular prompt.
4. Otherwise, OpenAB sends the regular `message` and the agent continues working.

`disable_on_success` is supported only in usercron `[[jobs]]`, not baseline `[[cron.jobs]]`. This keeps scheduler writeback limited to the user-managed cron file.

### Re-enabling a Disabled Job

Once a goal is achieved and the job is disabled, re-enable it by editing `$HOME/.openab/cronjob.toml`:

```toml
# Flip back to true to restart the job
enabled = true
```

This can be done manually, or by asking the AI agent (e.g. "re-enable the fix-unit-tests cron job").

### Kubernetes Deployment

Mount `cronjob.toml` on a PVC so it persists across pod restarts, and set `usercron_path` in your config.toml:

```toml
# config.toml
[cron]
usercron_enabled = true
# Relative to $HOME/.openab/ — resolves to $HOME/.openab/cronjob.toml
usercron_path = "cronjob.toml"
```

## Security Considerations

Cron jobs are system-initiated. When a job fires, the scheduler hands the prompt directly to the message router instead of going through a platform adapter, so a cron prompt is **not** subject to the inbound checks that apply to chat messages:

- the platform trust gate (`allowed_users` / `allowed_channels`)
- @mention requirements
- bot-message filtering

This is by design — scheduled jobs may target channels outside the human-facing allowlist (see the [Identity Trust-None ADR](adr/identity-trust-none.md)). The prompt runs with the same tool permissions as any other session (e.g. `--trust-all-tools`), and the message text is forwarded verbatim, so agent CLI commands such as `/clear` or `/model <id>` are executed as well.

The practical consequence: **whoever can write the cron configuration can run unattended prompts as the agent.** For baseline `[[cron.jobs]]`, that is whoever controls `config.toml`. For usercron, it is whoever can write `cronjob.toml` — which, with [Agent-Managed Schedules](#agent-managed-schedules), includes the agent itself.

For usercron, write access also means **command execution**: `disable_on_success` is run by OpenAB itself via `sh -c` (see [Goal-Driven Auto-Disable](#goal-driven-auto-disable)) on every schedule match, before the prompt is sent. It runs outside the agent's tool-permission model, so running the agent without `--trust-all-tools` does not limit it. An agent that can write files but not run shell commands can still get recurring shell execution by writing a `[[jobs]]` entry.

If your agent reads untrusted content (web pages, RSS feeds, transcripts, messages from other users), a prompt injection that persuades the agent to append a `[[jobs]]` entry turns a one-off injection into a recurring one that looks like a legitimate schedule — either as a prompt or as a `disable_on_success` shell command.

Mitigations:

- Leave `usercron_enabled = false` unless you need agent-managed schedules.
- Restrict the agent's own write access to `$HOME/.openab/` (where relative `usercron_path` resolves), or require approval for writes there, if your agent backend supports path-scoped tool permissions. Avoid `--trust-all-tools` for agents that ingest untrusted content. This is the preventive control.
- Review changes to `cronjob.toml` — for example, track it in git and diff it periodically, or watch it with a file monitor such as `inotifywait`. This only detects after the fact: the file is hot-reloaded on the next scheduler tick, so a new job can fire within a minute of being written.
- Put long-lived schedules in baseline `[[cron.jobs]]`, stored where the agent cannot write (e.g. a read-only mount or a Kubernetes ConfigMap).

## Behaviors

- **Minute-aligned**: The scheduler aligns to minute boundaries (`:00`), so `0 9 * * *` fires at exactly 09:00:00, not at whatever second the process started.
- **Overlap protection**: If a previous execution of the same job is still running, the next tick is skipped.
- **Isolation**: Cron failures are logged but never block interactive chat traffic.
- **Usercron persistence**: For usercron jobs, the scheduler may write `thread_id` and `enabled = false` back to `cronjob.toml`.
- **Graceful shutdown**: In-flight cron tasks are waited on (up to 30 seconds) during shutdown.

## Sender Identity

When a cron job fires, the agent sees a sender context like:

```
🕐 [DailyOps]: summarize yesterday's merged PRs
```

Use `sender_name` to distinguish different scheduled tasks in logs and thread titles. The agent can use this to tailor its response (e.g. "DailyOps asked for a summary" vs "WeeklyReport asked for a report").

## Platform Prerequisites

| Platform | Feature Flag | Config / Env Required |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| `discord` | (always enabled) | `[discord]` section in config.toml |
| `slack` | `--features slack` | `[slack]` section in config.toml |
| `telegram` | `--features telegram` | `[telegram]` section in config.toml **or** `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` env var |
| `googlechat` | `--features googlechat` | `[googlechat] enabled = true` in config.toml **or** `GOOGLE_CHAT_ENABLED=true` env var, plus credentials (`sa_key_json`/`sa_key_file`/`access_token` fields or their `GOOGLE_CHAT_*` env equivalents) |
| `lineworks` | `--features lineworks` | `[lineworks]` section in config.toml (or the `LINEWORKS_*` env equivalents) |

> **Note:** The `channel` field for Telegram should be the numeric chat ID (e.g. `"176096071"`). Use [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) or the Telegram Bot API `getUpdates` to find your chat ID.

For Google Chat, use the space resource name (for example, `"spaces/AAAA1234567"`). Jobs without `thread_id` stay at the top level of the space because Google Chat does not implement OpenAB's `create_topic` command. To post into an existing thread, set `thread_id` to its full Google Chat thread resource name.

For LINE WORKS, use a channel ID for group talks or `user:<userId>` (or `user:<loginId>`) for 1:1 delivery. LINE WORKS has no thread API, so cron messages always deliver to the flat channel; no synthetic thread is created and `thread_id` has no effect.

## When to Use External Schedulers Instead

Config-driven cron covers the 80% use case: "send this message at this time." For advanced needs, use external schedulers:

| Need | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Simple recurring prompts | ✅ Config-driven cron (this feature) |
| Long-running jobs (>5 min) | K8s CronJob |
| Conditional logic / retries | GitHub Actions or Step Functions |
| Multi-step workflows / DAGs | GitHub Actions or Step Functions |
| Per-execution isolation | K8s CronJob (separate Pod per run) |

See [Kubernetes CronJob Reference Architecture](cronjob_k8s_refarch.md) for the external scheduler approach.

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|---|---|
| Mixed numeric/name day-of-week | `1,Mon` or `Mon,3` is not supported and will be rejected. Use either all numeric (`1-5`) or all name-based (`Mon-Fri`) notation. |
| Wrap-around day-of-week ranges | `5-2` (Fri through Tue) is not supported. Use explicit listing instead: `5,6,0,1,2`. |

> **Tip:** Name-based notation (`Mon-Fri`, `Sun`, `Mon,Wed,Fri`) is always available as an alternative to numeric day-of-week values.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Job never fires | Invalid cron expression | Check logs for `invalid cron expression, skipping` |
| Job fires but no reply | Agent error | Check logs for `cron handle_message error` |
| Wrong time | Timezone mismatch | Set `timezone` explicitly (default is UTC) |
| Job skipped | Previous execution still running | Check logs for `skipping cronjob, previous execution still running` |
| Channel not found | Bot not in channel | Invite the bot to the target channel |
| Usercron not reloading | File not saved / wrong path | Check logs for `usercron file changed, reloading` |
| Usercron parse error | Invalid TOML syntax | Check logs for `failed to parse usercron file` |
| Goal job does not auto-disable | Command did not exit `0` or output did not include `disable_on_success_match` | Run the command manually and confirm both conditions |
